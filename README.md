This is a simple Discord bot to enable users to have embedded playable videos in their chats.
Simply if the bot recognizes a video link posted on any channel on the server (which is available for it) it will reply with another link which is the exact link to the video file and not to the post. This way Discord can create the video embed in the message.
This function is planned to be implemented for TikTok, Instagram and Facebook post as well

At this moment the but is under heavy development. Phase 1 is implemented, thus TikTok links are working as planned.

This Discord bot is a successor to the CapConvert bot

## It will run on AWS - Lightsail
Invite the bot to your server: FUTURE LINK
